# Image-Based Secret Message Encryption using CNN
This repository contains a Python application developed to encrypt secret messages using images by leveraging the concept of secret sharing. The project explores image-based encryption and decryption techniques, where an image is divided into multiple "shares" that, when superimposed, reconstruct the original image to reveal the encrypted message.

To enhance encryption quality and security, Machine Learning (ML) techniques were investigated, with a specific implementation using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for advanced image processing.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are:
<ul>
<li>Encryption: Convert a message into an encrypted image, which is divided into secret shares.</li>
<li>Decryption: Reconstruct the original image from the shares to reveal the encrypted message.</li>
<li>ML-Based Enhancement: Explore and implement CNN to improve encryption quality and security.</li>
</ul>

## Features
<li>Image-based Secret Sharing: Divides the encrypted image into multiple shares.</li>
<li>ML-Enhanced Encryption: Applies CNNs to improve encryption quality and security.</li>
<li>Message Reconstruction: Allows superimposing of shares to decrypt the image and reveal the original message.</li>
